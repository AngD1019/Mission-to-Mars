# Mission-to-Mars

## Objective

To scrape, organize, analyze, and visualize the data related to Mars news articles and Mars weather information. This was to be done by extracting an HTML table into a Pandas DataFrame, then using Pandas or Splinter and Beautiful Soup to scrape the data. 

* Deliverable 1: A Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars news titles and preview text.
* Deliverable 2: A Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars weather data and that cleans, visualizes, and analyzes that data.

The weather dataframe was exported into a CSV file and was uploaded into github.
